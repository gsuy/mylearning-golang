## start with command ...
- go mod init <projectname> // to create go.mod, like node init to create package.json but more betterrrr hahaha :)

## semantic versioning
- version of package e.g. x.xx.xxx (Major.Minor.Patch)
- x is Patch/Build => fix bug of system or little bug (low risk) 
- xx is Minor => new feature (medium risk)
- xxx is Major => big impack of package update (often followed by RC(Release Candidate), Preview, Beta for listen the problem) (high risk)
